Finally, he got up. </p><p>I watched him approach the lottery booth and ask for the nearest restroom. The booth attendant, (Middle Eastern, I think), didn\u2019t know of one. Maybe he just didn\u2019t know what the American was looking for. </p><p>As the American walked past, I called out to him. I told him there was one in the metro station behind us. He thanked me. </p><p>\u201cWhat a different world this is,\u201d he observed. I agreed with him. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s gorgeous.\u201d</p><p>\u201cBut weird.\u201d </p><p>I didn\u2019t respond. I let him disappear behind me. I didn\u2019t know what to tell him. I was already bothered enough. </p><p>I had just been in that metro station: Hostafrancs. There was a middle-aged man in there, playing guitar to a jazzy backing. His hair flowed everywhere, and his jacket was dirty. </p><p>I knew him. He had played at Pla\u00e7a Catalunya my first full day here, and I had stopped to listen. Nobody pays attention to the buskers. I caught his name: Mikha. We talked for a few minutes, and he told me he remembered me from the last time. I didn\u2019t have efectivo, but he said I\u2019d paid him enough. </p><p>We talked a bit more through our mutually broken Spanish. I think he was Serbian, with a name like Mikha, but he said he\u2019d just moved from Toulouse. </p><p>I told him I was going soon. </p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s a gorgeous city.

It warmed my back as it grew higher in the sky. </p><p>Enjoy the darkness while you still can, I told him. There\u2019ll be light when you return. </p><p>Unfortunately, he added. </p><p>We sat in silence, with only the yawns of the early morning birds and hum of electric train rails disturbing our peace. </p><p>I thought about the Guernica postcard that sat in my bag, sitting somewhere between the second and third chapters of my Exploring Spain travel guide. The postcard was blank. I bought it for myself. </p><p>I read about Picasso during the war, I cut in, breaking our silence. </p><p>Oh yea? What about him?</p><p>About how painful it was, being stuck in France. About being away from his bleeding land. I think I know how he felt. </p><p>Is that why the painting is in gray? Because he was shrouded in the dark?</p><p>Perhaps. It\u2019s how I feel anyways. I want to be there, experiencing the light. </p><p>You will be. Soon enough. </p><p>I know. </p><p>Feel this darkness, he tells me. The light will pierce deeper that way.</p>"

        "body": "<p>I\u2019m sitting on a train to Barcelona. The train\u2014de alta velocidad\u2014\u00a0has an advertised top speed of 187 MPH, but the speedometer on my phone reads 152. It\u2019ll probably speed up\u2014we aren\u2019t far from the station.\u00a0\u00a0<br>I spent the weekend in Madrid visiting friends from Berkeley. I walked thousands of steps but still feel like I didn\u2019t see much. Most of those steps were museum steps, and most of those museum steps were in the\u00a0Reina Sofia. I saw\u00a0Guernica\u00a0twice, once last night and once this morning. I wasn\u2019t done looking when they closed the museum.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>It feels weird to think about how long I\u2019ve been here. I landed on my 21st\u00a0birthday, January 9th. It wasn\u2019t until I left the city for the first time that I recognized the familiarity I\u2019ve developed with it. Even in Madrid I caught myself eager to return home to the little backyard hut I\u2019m renting in Gracia, with the pigeons on the roof and the little boy who screams with laughter at his YouTube shorts.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ve done a lot over the last two and a half weeks. Last weekend, I took the train up to Girona, a small old town along the French border. It was 45 minutes outside of Barcelona, and the views were stunning. In the distance, you could see snow covered peaks. I\u2019m pretty sure they were the Pyrenees. I thought of a story I read once years ago\u2014Hills Like White Elephants\u00a0by Ernest Hemingway. I joked that the mountains were like the hills in the story, but when I re-read the story on the train ride home, I realized that they probably were. It takes place at a train station in northeastern Spain, about 45 minutes outside of Barcelona. Maybe Hemingway was inspired by the same views I was\u2014maybe he was even standing in the same spot that I was! From that, he wrote a masterpiece, and I, this blog post. Oh well.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019m spending the next two weekends in France. I\u2019ll be in Toulouse with Georgia and a cohort of people she\u2019s met in Bordeaux. I\u2019m excited to meet more people. I knew coming in to this the type of person who studies abroad in Spain, but I\u2019ve done a decent job meeting other people. The weekend after that, I\u2019m going cave and ruin exploring with Val, up in those same mountains between France and Spain.\u00a0</p><p>The speedometer on my phone reads 176 MPH. Maybe this train will max out.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019m trying to find my place in Barcelona\u2014it\u2019s a city protective of its own, and cold to the outside. I understand why\u2014in ways I\u2019ve never seen in San Francisco, Barcelona is drowning in tourists. But it\u2019s created a binary (or at least I have): tourist or local. Outside my building is a large, spray-painted sentence that reads \u201cTourists Go Home.\u201d It\u2019s on the next street over too, and on buildings across the city. Every day on my walk to the metro, I think about it. Where am\u00a0I\u00a0in this binary? By being here, am I only contributing to the \u201coutsider pollution\u201d? Luckily enough, my Spanish is proficient. Luckily enough, I can play both sides of the dichotomy long enough to start a conversation. Or at least long enough for them to ask where in Asia I\u2019m from. It\u2019s a comforting fact that that\u2019s universal.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>The train\u2019s starting to slow down. I think we\u2019re pulling into our first stop.\u00a0</p>"

We\u2019ll drink plenty of alcohol and I\u2019ll drink more than them.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll be fine, I always am. I\u2019ll drink confidently and progressively louder. They\u2019ll look at each other and smile, enjoying the flavor of the evening. I\u2019ll also eat most of the food, as twinks eat little, and I don\u2019t know enough about nerds to generalize.\u00a0<br>The restaurant had the d\u00e9cor of a dance studio\u2014not that I was familiar with them, I don\u2019t do that kind of stuff.\u00a0<br>Mirrors ran floor to ceiling, with large gaps for natural light. There were no shadows, for the mirrors threw the light into every corner, and there was no hiding, for the mirrors displayed everyone at different angles.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll sit facing the mirror. That\u2019s my favorite seat; it\u2019s why I eat here so often. Alcohol gets better with a mirror\u2014the reflections are always different.<br>\u00a0<br>We\u2019ll take the fish because that\u2019s what I want. I\u2019ll look at them and wonder what it\u2019s like to be a twink and a nerd. I\u2019ll chuckle.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\u201cWhat a weird crowd this is,\u201d I\u2019ll tell myself.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll consider asking what they think people assume our connection to be\u2014given our obvious differences.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>This is a cool joint, and I want to be seen as cool here. Sometimes, people make assumptions, and I need it to be clear where I stand. A twink is a twink and a nerd is a nerd and I\u2019m just me. I don\u2019t ask them. Maybe the twink and the nerd haven\u2019t realized this grouping is unusual.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\u201cAt least I\u2019m aware of what this looks like,\u201d I\u2019ll resolve to myself, believing that our contrast would work to my favor. \u201cAt least I\u2019m across the table.\u201d<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll go the bathroom towards the end, pissing out the bottle of wine I drank, and look at myself in the mirror.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\u201cYou\u2019re so red,\u201d I\u2019ll tell myself.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll grab my hair, pulling it far from my scalp and slap water on my face. There\u2019ll be a pain under my left rib. I\u2019ll shrink and groan and make eye contact with the man in the mirror. There\u2019ll be a moment of silence as the child looking back turns his face and grows scared. There\u2019s a stranger looking at him.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>I\u2019ll return to the one-person table facing the mirrored wall and drink my wine quietly.\u00a0<br>\u00a0<br>\u201cI enjoy eating out alone,\u201d I\u2019ll tell my reflection, trying to cheer myself up. \u201cI shall do this again.\u201d</p>"
